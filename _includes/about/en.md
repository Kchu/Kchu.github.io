> Stay hungry. Stay Foolish. 

Hello everyone, I am CK. Now I am a master's student in computer science and technology. I am currently studying in-depth study and intensive study. I usually like to listen to songs, watch movies, write and write books, and read books. This blog is some of my essays and study notes, to share with you.

Seize the day, live at the moment. I hope that everyone can gain something and resonate.
