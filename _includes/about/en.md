> Stay hungry. Stay Foolish. 

Hello everyone, I am CK. Now I am a master in computer science and technology. I am currently studying deep learning and reinforcement learning. I usually like listening to songs, watching movies, writing books, and reading books. This blog includes some of my essays and study notes that I want to share with you.

Seize the day, live at the moment. I hope that everyone can gain something and resonate.
